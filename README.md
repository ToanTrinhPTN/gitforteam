## How to
### - From Develop Branch create a new branch to create new one or more Feature/ Branch 
###	- When we do finish Feature We can create a pull request for Reviewer
###	- Reviewer will check and megre or rebase Develop Branch to Staging
### - Reviewer will merge or rebase from Staging to Master Branch(It's will be tagged for new version) 
### - if It appear any problem in Master Branch We can fix it at Hotfix Branch then Changing Code will be asynchorous with Master(It's will be tagged for new version) and Develop Branch.
